The study of information transmission systems is inherently concerned with the transmission of signals through systems. Recall that in Chapter 1 a signal was defined as the time history of some quantity, usually a voltage or current. A system is a combination of devices and net- works (subsystems) chosen to perform a desired function. Because of the sophistication of modern communication systems, a great deal of analysis and experimentation with trial subsystems oc- curs before actual building of the desired system. Thus, the communications engineer’s tools are mathematical models for signals and systems.
In this chapter, we review techniques useful for modeling and analysis of signals and sys- tems used in communications engineering.1 Of primary concern will be the dual time-frequency viewpoint for signal representation, and models for linear, time-invariant, two-port systems. It is important to always keep in mind that a model is not the signal or the system, but a mathematical idealization of certain characteristics of it that are most relevant to the problem at hand.
With this brief introduction, we now consider signal classifications and various methods for modeling signals and systems. These include frequency-domain representations for signals via the complex exponential Fourier series and the Fourier transform, followed by linear system models and techniques for analyzing the effects of such systems on signals.

2.1 SIGNAL MODELS

2.1.1 Deterministic and Random Signals
  𝑥(𝑡) = 𝐴cos(𝜔0𝑡), −∞ < 𝑡 < ∞
  Π(𝑡) = 1, |𝑡| ≤ 2 (2.2) , = 0, otherwise
  
2.1.2 Periodic and Aperiodic Signals
  𝑥(𝑡+𝑇0)=𝑥(𝑡), −∞<𝑡<∞
  
2.1.3 Phasor Signals and Spectra
  𝑥̃(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑒𝑗(𝜔0𝑡+𝜃), −∞ < 𝑡 < ∞
  𝑥(𝑡)=𝐴cos(𝜔0𝑡+𝜃)= Re𝑥̃(𝑡) = Re𝐴𝑒𝑗(𝜔0𝑡+𝜃)
  𝐴 c o s ( 𝜔 0 𝑡 + 𝜃 ) = 1/2 𝑥̃ ( 𝑡 ) + 1/2 𝑥̃ ∗ ( 𝑡 ) = 1/2𝐴𝑒𝑗(𝜔0𝑡+𝜃) + 1/2𝐴𝑒−𝑗(𝜔0𝑡+𝜃)
  
2.1.4 Singularity Functions
  ∫ 𝑥(𝑡) 𝛿(𝑡) 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑥(0)
  ∫ 𝑥(𝑡) 𝛿(𝑡 − 𝑡0) 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑥(𝑡0)
  ∫ 𝛿(𝑡−𝑡0)𝑑𝑡=1, 𝑡1 <𝑡0 <𝑡2, 𝛿(𝑡−𝑡0)=0, 𝑡≠𝑡0
  
properties of the unit impulse function that can be proved from the definition   ∫ 𝑥(𝑡) 𝛿(𝑡) 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑥(0)

2.2 SIGNAL CLASSIFICATIONS
  Total energy and the average power on a per-ohm basis are obtained as the limits

2.3 FOURIER SERIES
  2.3.1 Complex Exponential Fourier Series
  2.3.2 Symmetry Properties of the Fourier Coefficients
  2.3.3 Trigonometric Form of the Fourier Series
  
2.4 THE FOURIER TRANSFORM
2.4.1 Amplitude and Phase Spectra: 𝑋(𝑓) = |𝑋(𝑓)|𝑒𝑗𝜃(𝑓), 𝜃(𝑓) = ⟋𝑋(𝑓)
      𝑅 = Re 𝑋(𝑓) = ∫ 𝑥(𝑡) cos (2𝜋𝑓𝑡) 𝑑𝑡
      𝐼 = Im𝑋(𝑓) = −∫𝑥(𝑡)sin(2𝜋𝑓𝑡)𝑑𝑡
      |𝑋(𝑓)|2 =𝑅2 +𝐼2 and tan𝜃(𝑓)=𝐼∕𝑅
2.4.2 Symmetry Properties:𝑥(𝑡) = 𝑥(−𝑡), that is, if 𝑥(𝑡) is even, then 𝑥(𝑡)sin(2𝜋𝑓𝑡) is odd in (2.66) and Im 𝑋(𝑓) = 0. Furthermore, Re 𝑋(𝑓) is an even function of 𝑓 because cosine is an even function. Thus, the Fourier transform of a real, even function is real and even.
2.4.3 Energy Spectral Density: 
      E = ∫ 𝑋(𝑓)𝑋∗ (𝑓) 𝑑𝑓
      |𝑋(𝑓)|2 has the units of energy density, 𝐺(𝑓 ) ≜ |𝑋(𝑓 )|2
2.4.4 Convolution: 𝑥(𝑡) = 𝑥1(𝑡) ∗ 𝑥2 (𝑡) = ∫ 𝑥1(𝜆)𝑥2(𝑡 − 𝜆) 𝑑𝜆
      𝑥1(𝑡) = 𝑒−𝛼𝑡𝑢(𝑡) and 𝑥2 (𝑡) = 𝑒−𝛽𝑡𝑢(𝑡), 𝛼 > 𝛽 > 0
   => 𝑥(𝑡) = 𝑥1(𝑡) ∗ 𝑥2(𝑡) = ∫ 𝑒−𝛼𝜆𝑢(𝜆)𝑒−𝛽(𝑡−𝜆)𝑢(𝑡 − 𝜆)𝑑𝜆
                 ⎧0, 𝜆<0 
   => 𝑢(𝜆)𝑢(𝑡−𝜆)= ⎨1, 0<𝜆<𝑡
                 ⎩0, 𝜆>𝑡
