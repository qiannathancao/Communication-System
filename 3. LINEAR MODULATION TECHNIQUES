LINEAR MODULATION TECHNIQUES

The two basic types of analog modulation are continuous-wave modulation and pulse modu- lation. In continuous-wave modulation, which is the main focus of this chapter, a parameter of a high-frequency carrier is varied proportionally to the message signal such that a one-to-one corre- spondence exists between the parameter and the message signal. The carrier is usually assumed to be sinusoidal, but as will be illustrated, this is not a necessary restriction. However, for a sinusoidal carrier, a general modulated carrier can be represented mathematically as
𝒙𝒄 (𝒕) = 𝑨(𝒕) 𝐜𝐨𝐬[𝟐𝝅𝒇𝒄 𝒕 + 𝝓(𝒕)] (3.1)
where 𝒇𝒄 is the carrier frequency. Since a sinusoid is completely specified by its amplitude, 𝑨(𝒕), and instantaneous phase, 𝟐𝝅𝒇𝒄 + 𝝓(𝒕), it follows that once the carrier frequency, 𝒇𝒄 , is specified, only two parameters are candidates to be varied in the modulation process: the instantaneous amplitude 𝑨(𝒕) and the phase deviation 𝝓(𝒕). When the amplitude 𝑨(𝒕) is linearly related to the modulating signal, the result is linear modulation. Letting 𝝓(𝒕) or the time derivative of 𝝓(𝒕) be linearly related to the modulating signal yields phase or frequency modulation, respectively. Collectively, phase and frequency modulation are referred to as angle modulation, since the instantaneous phase angle of the modulated carrier conveys the information.
