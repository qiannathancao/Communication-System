# Communication-System

Communication systems such a the telephone, radio, television, and the Internet have inarguably been some of the greatest engineering achievements of the past century. This class will provide an interaction to the engineering principles underlying these systems, with an focus on understanding different types of modulation and the impact of bandwidth and noise.

II: LINEAR MODULATION TECHNIQUES

III: ANGLE MODULATION AND MULTIPLEXING

IV: PROBABILITY AND RANDOM VARIABLES

V: RANDOM SIGNALS AND NOISE
