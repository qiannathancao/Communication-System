# Communication-System

Communication systems such a the telephone, radio, television, and the Internet have inarguably been some of the greatest engineering achievements of the past century. This class will provide an interaction to the engineering principles underlying these systems, with an focus on understanding different types of modulation and the impact of bandwidth and noise.

I: SIGNAL AND LINEAR SYSTEM ANALYSIS

The study of information transmission systems is inherently concerned with the transmission of signals through systems. Recall that in Chapter 1 a signal was defined as the time history of some quantity, usually a voltage or current. A system is a combination of devices and net- works (subsystems) chosen to perform a desired function. Because of the sophistication of modern communication systems, a great deal of analysis and experimentation with trial subsystems oc- curs before actual building of the desired system. Thus, the communications engineer’s tools are mathematical models for signals and systems.
In this chapter, we review techniques useful for modeling and analysis of signals and sys- tems used in communications engineering.1 Of primary concern will be the dual time-frequency viewpoint for signal representation, and models for linear, time-invariant, two-port systems. It is important to always keep in mind that a model is not the signal or the system, but a mathematical idealization of certain characteristics of it that are most relevant to the problem at hand.
With this brief introduction, we now consider signal classifications and various methods for modeling signals and systems. These include frequency-domain representations for signals via the complex exponential Fourier series and the Fourier transform, followed by linear system models and techniques for analyzing the effects of such systems on signals.

II: LINEAR MODULATION TECHNIQUES

Before an information-bearing signal is transmitted through a communication channel, some type of modulation process is typically utilized to produce a signal that can easily be accommodated by the channel. In this chapter we will discuss various types of linear modulation techniques. The modulation process commonly translates an information-bearing signal, usually referred to as the message signal, to a new spectral location depending upon the intended frequency for transmission. For example, if the signal is to be transmitted through the atmosphere or free space, frequency translation is necessary to raise the signal spectrum to a frequency that can be radiated efficiently with antennas of reasonable size. If more than one signal utilizes a channel, modulation allows translation of different signals to different spectral locations, thus allowing the receiver to select the desired signal. Multiplexing allows two or more message signals to be transmitted by a single transmitter and received by a single receiver simultaneously. The logical choice of a modulation technique for a specific application is influenced by the characteristics of the message signal, the characteristics of the channel, the performance desired from the overall communication system, the use to be made of the transmitted data, and the economic factors that are always important in practical applications.
The two basic types of analog modulation are continuous-wave modulation and pulse modu- lation. In continuous-wave modulation, which is the main focus of this chapter, a parameter of a high-frequency carrier is varied proportionally to the message signal such that a one-to-one corre- spondence exists between the parameter and the message signal. The carrier is usually assumed to be sinusoidal, but as will be illustrated, this is not a necessary restriction. However, for a sinusoidal carrier, a general modulated carrier can be represented mathematically as
𝒙𝒄 (𝒕) = 𝑨(𝒕) 𝐜𝐨𝐬[𝟐𝝅𝒇𝒄 𝒕 + 𝝓(𝒕)] (3.1)
where 𝒇𝒄 is the carrier frequency. Since a sinusoid is completely specified by its amplitude, 𝑨(𝒕), and instantaneous phase, 𝟐𝝅𝒇𝒄 + 𝝓(𝒕), it follows that once the carrier frequency, 𝒇𝒄 , is specified, only two parameters are candidates to be varied in the modulation process: the instantaneous amplitude 𝑨(𝒕) and the phase deviation 𝝓(𝒕). When the amplitude 𝑨(𝒕) is linearly related to the modulating signal, the result is linear modulation. Letting 𝝓(𝒕) or the time derivative of 𝝓(𝒕) be linearly related to the modulating signal yields phase or frequency modulation, respectively. Collectively, phase and frequency modulation are referred to as angle modulation, since the instantaneous phase angle of the modulated carrier conveys the information.

III: ANGLE MODULATION AND MULTIPLEXING

In the previous chapter, we considered analog linear modulation. We now consider angle modu- lation. To generate angle modulation, the amplitude of the modulated carrier is held constant and either the phase or the time derivative of the phase of the carrier is varied linearly with the message signal 𝒎(𝒕). These lead to phase modulation (PM) or frequency modulation (FM), respectively.
The most efficient technique for demodulating angle modulated signals is the phase-locked loop (PLL). The PLL is ubiquitous in modern communication systems. Both analog systems and, as we will see later, digital systems make extensive use of PLLs. Because of the importance of the PLL, we give considerable emphasis to it in this chapter.
Also in this chapter we consider pulse modulation techniques related to angle modulation, PWM and PPM. The motivation for doing this is, with the exception of pulse-amplitude modu- lation, many of the characteristics of pulse modulation are similar to the characteristics of angle modulation.

IV: PROBABILITY AND RANDOM VARIABLES

The objective of this chapter is to review probability theory in order to provide a background for the mathematical description of random signals. In the analysis and design of communication systems it is necessary to develop mathematical models for random signals and noise, or random processes, which will be accomplished in Chapter 7.

V: RANDOM SIGNALS AND NOISE

The mathematical background reviewed in Chapter 6 on probability theory provides the basis for developing the statistical description of random waveforms. The importance of considering such waveforms, as pointed out in Chapter 1, lies in the fact that noise in communication systems is due to unpredictable phenomena, such as the random motion of charge carriers in conducting materials and other unwanted sources.
In the relative-frequency approach to probability, we imagined repeating the underlying chance experiment many times, the implication being that the replication process was carried out sequentially in time. In the study of random waveforms, however, the outcomes of the underlying chance experiments are mapped into functions of time, or waveforms, rather than numbers, as in the case of random variables. The particular waveform is not predictable in advance of the experiment, just as the particular value of a random variable is not predictable before the chance experiment is performed. We now address the statistical description of chance experiments that result in waveforms as outputs. To visualize how this may be accomplished, we again think in terms of relative frequency.
