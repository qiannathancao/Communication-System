ANGLE MODULATION AND MULTIPLEXING
In the previous chapter, we considered analog linear modulation. We now consider angle modu- lation. 
To generate angle modulation, the amplitude of the modulated carrier is held constant and either the 
phase or the time derivative of the phase of the carrier is varied linearly with the message signal 𝒎(𝒕). 
These lead to phase modulation (PM) or frequency modulation (FM), respectively.

The most efficient technique for demodulating angle modulated signals is the phase-locked loop (PLL). 
The PLL is ubiquitous in modern communication systems. Both analog systems and, 
as we will see later, digital systems make extensive use of PLLs. 
Because of the importance of the PLL, we give considerable emphasis to it in this chapter.

4.1 PHASE AND FREQUENCY MODULATION DEFINED
  𝑥𝑐(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑐 cos[2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 𝜙(𝑡)]
  𝜃𝑖(𝑡) = 2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 𝜙(𝑡)
  
  phase modulation: 𝜙(𝑡) = 𝑘𝑝𝑚(𝑡)
  frequency modulation: 𝜙(𝑡) = 𝑘𝑓 ∫ 𝑚(𝛼)𝑑𝛼 + 𝜙0
  
  where 𝑘𝑓 = 2𝜋𝑓𝑑: 
  (𝑓𝑑 is known as the frequency-deviation constant)
  
  Phase modulator output is: 𝑥𝑐(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑐 cos[2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 𝑘𝑝𝑚(𝑡)]
  Frequency modulator output is: 𝑥𝑐(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑐 cos [2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 2𝜋𝑓𝑑 ∫ 𝑚(𝛼)𝑑𝛼]
  
4.1.1 Narrowband Angle Modulation
    𝑥𝑐(𝑡) = Re(𝐴𝑐𝑒𝑗𝜙(𝑡)𝑒𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡)
  Modulated carrier can be approximated as:    
    𝑥𝑐(𝑡) ≅ Re[𝐴𝑐𝑒𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 𝐴𝑐𝜙(𝑡)𝑗𝑒𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡]
  Taking the real part:
    𝑥𝑐 (𝑡) ≅ 𝐴𝑐 cos(2𝜋𝑓𝑐 𝑡) − 𝐴𝑐 𝜙(𝑡) sin(2𝜋𝑓𝑐 𝑡)

4.1.2 Spectrum of an Angle-Modulated Signal
  In order to compute the spectrum of an angle-modulated signal with a sinusoidal message signal, we assume that
    𝜙(𝑡) = 𝛽 sin(2𝜋𝑓𝑚𝑡)  
  The parameter 𝛽 is known as the modulation index and is the maximum phase deviation for
  both FM and PM. The signal
    𝑥𝑐(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑐 cos[2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 𝛽 sin(2𝜋𝑓𝑚𝑡)]
 => 𝑥𝑐(𝑡) = Re[𝑥̃𝑐(𝑡)𝑒𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡]
 
 The integral is a function of 𝑛 and 𝛽 and is known as the Bessel function 
 of the first kind of order 𝑛 and argument 𝛽
   𝑥𝑐(𝑡)= 𝐴𝑐 ∑ 𝐽𝑛(𝛽)cos[2𝜋(𝑓𝑐 +𝑛𝑓𝑚)𝑡]
 definition of 𝐽𝑛(𝛽) it can be determined that
   𝐽−𝑛(𝛽) = 𝐽𝑛(𝛽), 𝑛 even 
   𝐽−𝑛(𝛽) = −𝐽𝑛(𝛽), 𝑛 odd
   
4.1.3 Power in an Angle-Modulated Signal
  ⟨𝑥2𝑐(𝑡)⟩ = 𝐴2𝑐⟨cos2[2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 𝜙(𝑡)]⟩
=>⟨𝑥𝑐^2(𝑡)⟩ = (𝐴𝑐^2)/2

4.1.4 Bandwidth of Angle-Modulated Signals
  𝐽𝑛(𝛽) ≈ 𝛽𝑛/(2^𝑛)𝑛!
  For fixed 𝛽, lim 𝐽𝑛(𝛽) = 0, 𝑛→∞
  The power ratio 𝑃𝑟 is defined as: 𝑃𝑟 = 𝐽02(𝛽) + 2∑𝐽𝑛2(𝛽), 𝑘~𝑛=1
  Resulting bandwidth is 𝐵 = 2𝑘𝑓𝑚
  => 𝐵 ≅ 2(𝛽 + 1)𝑓𝑚
  Bandwidth results if the deviation ratio 𝐷 is defined as: 𝐷 = peak frequency deviation / bandwidth of 𝑚(𝑡)
  => 𝐷 = 𝑓𝑑 (max | 𝑚(𝑡)|) / 𝑊
  Replacing 𝛽 by 𝐷 and replacing 𝑓𝑚 by 𝑊: 
  => 𝐵 = 2(𝐷 + 1)𝑊
  
4.1.5 Narrowband-to-Wideband Conversion
  Narrowband FM signal: 
  Carrier frequency = fc1
  Peak frequency deviation = fd1 
  Deviation ratio = D1
  >>
  Wideband FM signal:
  Carrier frequency = fc2 = nfc1
  Peak frequency deviation = fd2 = nfd1 
  Deviation ratio = D2 = nD1
  
  Input of a frequency multiplier is:     𝑥(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑐 cos[2𝜋𝑓0𝑡 + 𝜙(𝑡)]
  Output of the frequency multiplier is:  𝑦(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑐 cos[2𝜋𝑛𝑓0𝑡 + 𝑛𝜙(𝑡)]
  Assuming that the output of the local oscillator is: 𝑒LO(𝑡) = 2 cos(2𝜋𝑓LO𝑡)
=>𝑓𝑐 =𝑛𝑓0 +𝑓LO or 𝑓𝑐 =𝑛𝑓0 −𝑓LO
=>𝑥𝑐(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑐 cos[2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 𝑛𝜙(𝑡)] 

4.2 DEMODULATION OF ANGLE-MODULATED SIGNALS  
  circuits are known as frequency discriminators (demodulator)
  input to an ideal discriminator is the angle-modulated signal: 𝑥𝑟(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑐 cos[2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 𝜙(𝑡)]
  output of the ideal discriminator is: 𝑦𝐷(𝑡)= 1/2𝜋 K𝐷 𝑑𝜙/𝑑𝑡
  
  PM discriminator as: 𝑦𝐷(𝑡) = 𝐾𝐷𝑘𝑝𝑚(𝑡)
  output of the envelope detector is: 𝑦𝐷 (𝑡)=𝐴𝑐 𝑑𝜙/𝑑𝑡 = 2𝜋𝐴𝑐 𝑓𝑑𝑚(𝑡) 
  
  Assuming transfer function is:
  𝐻(𝑓) = 𝑅/(𝑅 + 1∕𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝐶) = 𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑅𝐶 / (1 + 𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑅𝐶)
  Transfer function can be approximated by: 𝐻(𝑓) = 𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑅𝐶
  Then: 𝐾𝐷 = 2𝜋𝐴𝑐𝑅𝐶
  
4.3 FEEDBACK DEMODULATORS: THE PHASE-LOCKED LOOP
Phase-locked loops are widely used in today’s communication systems, 
not only for demodulation of angle- modulated signals but also for carrier and symbol synchronization.

4.3.1 Phase-Locked Loops for FM and PM Demodulation
  A block diagram of a PLL is shown in Figure 4.18. The basic PLL contains four basic elements. These are
  1. Phase detector
  2. Loop filter
  3. Loop amplifier (assume 𝜇 = 1)
  4. Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).
  
  Assume that the input signal is given by: 𝑥𝑟(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑐 cos[2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 𝜙(𝑡)]
  VCO output signal is given by: 𝑒0(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑣 sin[2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 𝜃(𝑡)]
  
  A VCO is essentially a frequency modulator in which the frequency deviation of the output, 
  𝑑𝜃∕𝑑𝑡, is proportional to the VCO input signal.
  𝑑𝜃/𝑑𝑡 = 𝐾𝑣 𝑒𝑣(𝑡) rad∕𝑠 
  𝜃(𝑡) = 𝐾𝑣 ∫ 𝑒𝑣(𝛼)𝑑𝛼 , 𝐾𝑣 is known as the VCO constan
  loop gain 𝐾𝑡 = 1/2 𝐴𝑣𝐴𝑐𝐾𝑑𝐾𝑣, input signal amplitude 𝐴𝑣
  
4.4 INTERFERENCE IN ANGLE MODULATION
  Input to the discriminator is assumed to have the form: 
  𝑥𝑡(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑐 cos(2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡) + 𝐴𝑖 cos[2𝜋(𝑓𝑐 + 𝑓𝑖)𝑡]
       = 𝐴𝑐 cos(2𝜋𝑓𝑖𝑡) + 𝐴𝑖 cos(2𝜋𝑓𝑖𝑡) cos(2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡) − 𝐴𝑖 sin(2𝜋𝑓𝑖) sin(2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡)
  Preceding expression in magnitude and phase form gives: 
  𝑥𝑟(𝑡) = 𝑅(𝑡) cos[2𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑡 + 𝜓(𝑡)]     
  
  Amplitude 𝑅(𝑡) is given by: 
    𝑅(𝑡) =√([𝐴𝑐 + 𝐴𝑖 cos(2𝜋𝑓𝑖𝑡)]^2 + [𝐴𝑖 sin(2𝜋𝑓𝑖𝑡)]^2)
  Phase deviation 𝜓(𝑡) is given by:
    𝜓(𝑡) = tan−1(𝐴𝑖 sin(2𝜋𝑓𝑖𝑡)/[𝐴𝑐 + 𝐴𝑖 cos(2𝜋𝑓𝑖𝑡)] )
  If 𝐴𝑐 ≫ 𝐴𝑖, 𝑅(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑐 + 𝐴𝑖 cos(2𝜋𝑓𝑖𝑡)
  and 𝜓(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑖/𝐴𝑐 + 𝐴𝑖 cos(2𝜋𝑓𝑖𝑡)
  𝑦𝐷(𝑡)=𝐾𝐷 𝐴𝑖/𝐴𝑐 𝑓𝑖cos(2𝜋𝑓𝑡)
